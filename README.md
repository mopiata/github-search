# _Github Search_

#### By Margaret Mutungi

## Description

This web application allows a user to search for GitHub users using a person's username or for public repositories in GitHub using their names as well.

## How it works
A user enters a username or repository name in the search box. This queries github and returns results for the user to see. They can then select the result to see a few more details. They can also be redirected to the github link that pointing to the user or repository if they choose. 

The landing page of the site contains my GitHub information with my username, avatar (profile picture) and a list of repos and their descriptions. This will serve as a template for any other user display.
